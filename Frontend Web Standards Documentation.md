# Frontend Web Standards Documentation

## Low Level

### 1. Exposed API / Hardcoded API : ``âœ… Done``
Avoid hardcoding API URLs. Use environment variables for dynamic configuration and to separate development, staging, and production environments.

### 2. Input Validation : ``âœ… Done``
Ensure all input fields are validated both client-side and server-side. Use a combination of HTML5 attributes and custom logic to enforce robust validation:

#### Key Validation Rules:``âœ… Done``
- **Input Length**: Restrict the number of characters using the `maxlength` attribute or JavaScript validation.
- **Required Fields**: Use the `required` attribute to ensure mandatory fields are not left empty.
- **Input Type Restrictions**:
  - **Names**: Allow only alphabetic characters. Use regular expressions to validate.
 
  - **Email Format**: Validate email addresses to ensure they follow standard formats.

  - **Username Blacklist**: Prevent the use of restricted usernames like `admin`, `root`, etc.


### 3. Input Length Restrictions : ``âœ… Done``
Limit input character length using the `maxlength` attribute or JS validation to prevent buffer overflows and malicious input.

### 4. Lack of Character Filtering :``âœ… Done``
Sanitize inputs to prevent XSS or injection attacks.

Consider libraries like DOMPurify for sanitizing inputs before rendering.

### 5. No Client-Side Validation for Required Fields : ``âœ… Done``
Use HTML5 `required` attribute or JS validation.


### 6. Real-Time Input Validation ``âœ… Done``
Provide instant feedback to users using `onChange` or `onInput` handlers with visual cues (e.g., red borders, icons).

### 7. Missing Form Submission Feedback ``âœ… Done``
Add a loading state to indicate progress.


### 8. Clear Form After Submission ``âœ… Done``
Reset form state after successful submission.


### 9. Improper Handling of Form Re-Submission ``âœ… Done``
Prevent accidental resubmissions using disabled buttons or unique request IDs.


### 10. No Protection Against CSRF in Forms ``ðŸŒ€ Pending ``
Include and validate CSRF tokens in form submissions.

Ensure your backend framework supports CSRF validation.

## Intermediate Level

### 11. Loading Indicators ``âœ… Done : but didn't tested`` 
Show loading spinners, progress bars, or skeleton screens while content is loading.

### 12. Errors Handling
Use `try/catch` blocks, global error boundaries, and alert components to inform users.

### 13. Centralized API Service
Create a module to handle requests (e.g., using Axios) to manage base URLs, headers, interceptors, and error handling.

### 14. Secure API Fetching
Avoid raw `fetch` without checks.

### 15. State Management
Use tools like React Context, Redux, Recoil, or Zustand to manage state across components effectively.

### 16. Error Boundary
Use React Error Boundaries to gracefully handle render-time crashes and show fallback UIs.

### 17. Responsive Design
Use CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries to adapt layouts to all screen sizes and devices.

### 18. Debouncing/Throttling for Input Events
Improve performance in high-frequency input handlers (like search).


### 19. Poor Error Handling for Form Submissions ``âœ… Done : but haven't been tested`` 
Provide user feedback on API failure using messages, toasts, or modals.

## Advanced Level

### 20. Unit Testing
Write tests with Jest, React Testing Library, Vitest, or Cypress for components, logic, and integration.

### 21. Session Expiration Handling
Use Axios interceptors or fetch wrappers to detect 401 errors and refresh tokens silently or redirect to login.

### 22. Secure Storage for Tokens
Store sensitive tokens in HttpOnly cookies. Avoid using localStorage for storing access tokens.

### 23. Inefficient Rendering
Use memoization techniques (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) to avoid unnecessary re-renders.


### 24. Code Splitting
Use dynamic `import()` and React.lazy to load components only when needed.

### 25. Accessibility Features
Use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and ensure keyboard and screen reader support for all UI elements.

### 26."Remember Me" functionality:
Allow users to stay logged in by securely storing tokens and implementing auto-login functionality.

## Optional Features

### 27. PWA and Offline Support
Enable service workers, caching strategies (e.g., Workbox), and manifest files to make the app installable and offline-capable.
